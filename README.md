# FinalProject - I chose this Python Project because I felt it would be a fun and interesting application for a project that encourages user input in guessing the answers. I also enjoy quizes and trivia games so this was the best way i could think to apply this with the limited Python Programming knowledge that I have. Real world applications could be a fun way for students to learn python that is not too complex and simple enough for beginer to intermediate. The way it works will be using all Python code to run and prompt the user if they got a question right or wrong. You can put any possible questions and answers you want into the quiz function and it will tell you if your guess is right or not. This is a good way for beginners to practice their newfound programming skills, which is what I did. I was able to apply my very limited Programming knowledge to a fun and interesting project.
